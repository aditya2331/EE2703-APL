    "It is interesting to observe that the __recursive implementation takes about double the amount of time taken by the iterative implementation__. However, this can be explained by the fact that in the recursive function, at each step the copy of the function with all variables is stored in memory (one step). When the base case is reached, the recursive calls are stopped, and the copies in memory return their values one by one (another step). After all values are returned, the function terminates. Thus the loop only has to iterate through every number once whereas the recursive function has to iterate until it reaches the end and then come back as well.\n",

    "* Iterate through each component in the circuit. By analysing KCL at each node, we can fill the matrix. For each component, we know that its value will appear 4 times: twice positive at the nodes on the diagonal and twice negative at the non-diagonal elements (symetrically) whose row and column index are determined by the nodes to which it is connected.\n",
    "* For each voltage source, we must add an extra dimension to the A and B matrices. In A, to account for the new equation corresponding to the source we add a row, and for the new auxiliary current variable passing through it we add a column. In B, we add a new element '0' to match this size change. Without loss of generality we add all these dimensions at the ends of the matrices. The value of the voltage source is filled in B, and we fill '+1's and '-1's in the array A wherever required according to the nodes to which it is connected.\n",
    "* For each current source, we only need to modify the B matrix at the nodes to which it is connected. __We have considered currents entering to be negative and currents leaving to be postive. Thus by netlist convention, the current is positive in the B matrix at the node it enters, and vice versa.__\n",
    "* For AC components and sources, the values have been transformed accordingly and the same procedure for filling the matrix is followed.\n",
    "* After all this is done, we must __remember to delete the row and column in the A matrix corresponding to the GND node, since it should not appear in the final MNA matrix. We included it just to make our code simpler (by not having to check for it whenever we fill the matrix). Similarly delete the corresponding element in the B matrix. By our convention, this has been taken as the first column, row and element.__\n",
