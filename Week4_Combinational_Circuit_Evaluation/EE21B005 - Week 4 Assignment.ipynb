    "\n",
    "* As the size of the netlists increase, the time difference is more noticeable. The queue solver starts taking almost double (sometimes even more) the amount of time taken by the topological solver. This is because even though the circuit is re-evauluated at each stage in the topological solver, the number of steps always stays the same, and it is equal to the number of nodes in the graph. However, for the queue solver the initial queue itself is very large and this takes up most of the time in the evaluation. \n",

    "* Ultimately, the time taken depends on the size of the graph and the degree of variance of input vectors. If input vectors vary a lot, then the event-driven method offers no advantage, and is in fact slower. Only for very large circuits in which we change only a few outputs at each stage, the queue method will be faster. Otherwise it is better to stick with the topological sort method.\n",
